To create the docker image, run

```
sudo docker build -t ds_283_prod .
```

We are good to go. Now for testing, I mount my `gargle` cached authentifications(and other google auths too)  into the container and run it like so

```

sudo docker run -it  -v ~/.R:/root/.R  -v ~/.config:/root/.config ds_283_prod

```



And that ought be it! The dashboard is copied to `gs://moz-fx-data-prod-analysis/sguha/ds_283/`.
